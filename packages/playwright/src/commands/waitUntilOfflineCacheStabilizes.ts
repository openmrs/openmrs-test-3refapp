 * Periodically polls the number of items in the SPA's offline cache and waits until that number
 * hasn't changed since the last check.
 * 
 * This is a dirty and potentially flaky way to wait until resources are either added or removed
 * from the app's cache. It can, for example, be used to wait until the app has precached its
 * resources when loading for the first time.
 * 
 * Depending on the use case, this approach could be replaced with a better solution.
 * For example, when waiting for the app to become offline-ready, it would be much better to
 * wait for a UI element showing that the app is ready now (which, at the time of writing this
 * comment, does not exist, hence the creation of this function).
